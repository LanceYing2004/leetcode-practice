    "### Problem\n",
    "Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's. \n",

    "I immediate came across a recent example I did regarding flipping at most 1 0's to 1. Which is basically the same thing! (great job identifying the patterns!) Instead just like a sliding window approach, all I need to change is create a quota (falls under the k) and a while check (make sure proper 0 is removed at the left most part), and then the rest algorithm would be the same"

    "The first one is version #1, and second one I made a great progress on runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes:\n",
    "- I realized that if k == nums.size(), then basically all the numbers could be flipped to 1. Just return the k in this case.\n",
    "- result calculation happens when the winder length updates, and where there's no change to the count (e.g. nums =[0,0,1,1] and k = 1, in this case there's no need to change the count in the end, so none of the result calulation will be executed if there's not a sperate statement at the end)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second point, I moved my final calculation outside of the loop, since that counts as a special case and no need to run that over and over again inside a loop. That just will be used for special case in case the final calculation result (in the example, it would be 3), greater than the original result (which would be 1)"
