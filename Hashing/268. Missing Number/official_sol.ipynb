    "Input: nums = [3,0,1]  \n",
    "Output: 2  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n",

    "### Brute Force and Brute Force Set\n",
    "A brute force method for solving this problem would be to simply check for the presence of each number that we expect to be present.
