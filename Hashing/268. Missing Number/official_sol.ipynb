    "Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "Input: nums = [3,0,1]  \n",
    "Output: 2  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "Input: nums = [0,1]  \n",
    "Output: 2  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n",

    "Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]  \n",
    "Output: 8  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.\n",

    "- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>\n",
    "- 0 <= nums[i] <= n\n",
    "- All the numbers of nums are unique.\n"
