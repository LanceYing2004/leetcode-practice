    "- You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.\n",
    "- The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.\n",

    "## Approach 1: Hash Set\n",
    "Create 3 hash set to store players with different losses. (zero loss, one loss, more loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each iteration, or each match, 2 players (winner and loser) may need to move to other sets and we update the sets. That is remove the current player from the current set (zero loss or one loss) and move it to the next container (one loss or more loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Initialize three empty hash sets, zero_loss, one_loss and more_losses.\n",
    "2. Iterate over matches, for each match [winner, loser], update the sets they are in according to the following rule:\n",
    "  - For Winner:\n",
    "    - If winner is not in more_losses or one_loss, it means he should be in zero_loss, add it to zero_loss.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, the number of losses for winner doesn't change, do not change the player.\n",
    "  - For Loser:\n",
    "    - If loser is in zero_loss, remove it from zero_loss and add it to one_loss since this player has one more loss now.\n",
    "    - If loser is in one_loss, remove it from one_loss and add it to more_losses since this player has one more loss now.\n",
    "    - If loser is in more_losses, keep this player in more_losses.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, if loser can't be found in those three containers, then this match is loser's first match, we add this player to one_loss.\n",
    "3. After the iteration ends, get the players from zero_loss and one_loss and sort them.\n",
    "\n",
