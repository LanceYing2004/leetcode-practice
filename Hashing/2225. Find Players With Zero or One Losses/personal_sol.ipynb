    "## Problem\n",
    "You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winner<sub>i</sub>, loser<sub>i</sub>] indicates that the player winner<sub>i</sub> defeated player loser<sub>i</sub> in a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a list answer of size 2 where:\n",
    "- answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.\n",
    "- answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the two lists should be returned in **increasing** order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.\n",
    "- The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]  \n",
    "Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.  \n",
    "Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.  \n",
    "Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.  \n",
    "Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].  \n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]  \n",
    "Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]  \n",
    "Explanation:  \n",
    "Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.  \n",
    "Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.  \n",
    "Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- 1 <= matches.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>\n",
    "- matches[i].length == 2\n",
    "- 1 <= winner<sub>i</sub>, loser<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>5</sup>\n",
    "- winner<sub>i</sub> != loser<sub>i</sub>\n",
    "- All matches[i] are unique."
