    "Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.\n",

    "**Example 1:**  \n",
    "Input: arr = [1,2,3]  \n",
    "Output: 2  \n",
    "Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.  \n",
